Evolution of Operating Systems.

The evolution of OS is directyl dependent on the development of computer systems and how users use them.
Here is a quick tour of computing systems through the past fifty years in the timeline.


Early Evolution
    
    1945: ENIAC
    1949: EDVAC
    1952: IBM 701
    1956: The interrupt
    1957: FORTRAN was developed


1950s

    By the late 1950s Operating systems were well improved and started supporting following usages:

        - It was able to perform Single stream batch processing.
        - It could use Common, standardized, input/output routines for device access.
        - Program transition capabilities to reduce the overhead of starting a new job was added.
        - Error recovery to clean up after a job terminated abnormally was added.
        - Job control languages that allowed users to specify the job definition and resource requirements were made possible.

1960s

    1961: The dawn of minicomputers
    1962: Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) from MIT
    1964: IBM System/360
    1960s: Disks became mainstream
    1966: Minicomputers got cheaper, more powerful, and really useful.
    1967-1968: Mouse was invented.
    1964 and onward: Multics
    1969: The UNIX Time-Sharing System from Bell Telephone Laboratories.

1970s

    Multi User and Multi tasking was introduced.
    Dynamic address translation hardware and Virtual machines came into picture.
    Modular architectures came into existence.
    Personal, interactive systems came into existence.

After 1970s
    1971: Intel announces the microprocessor
    1972: IBM comes out with VM: the Virtual Machine Operating System
    1973: Ethernet
    1976: Apple II
    1983 Microsoft begins work on MS-Windows
    1984 Apple Macintosh comes out
    1990 Microsoft Windows 3.0 comes out
    1991 GNU/Linux
    1992 The first Windows virus comes out
    1993 Windows NT
    2007: iOS
    2008: Android OS


And as the research and development work continues, we are seeing new 
operating systems being developed and existing ones getting improved and 
modified to enhance the overall user experience, making operating systems 
fast and efficient like never before.
